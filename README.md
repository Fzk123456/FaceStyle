# FaceStyle: Example-based Stylization of Face Portraits

> Code to generate G_seg, G_pos and G_app images from "Example-Based Synthesis of Stylized Facial Animations" by JAKUB FIÅ ER et al.

The [ebsynth](https://github.com/jamriska/ebsynth) repository provides code to perform [facestyle](https://github.com/jamriska/ebsynth#facestyle-example-based-stylization-of-face-portraits) which transfers the style of a portrait painting onto another person's photograph.

Besides the source and target images, the algorithm requires a soft segmentation guide `G_seg`, a positional guide `G_pos` and an appearance guide `G_app`. The code to generate these images from both the source and target images was not provided.

In this repository you can find the code and models to generate the aforementioned images.
